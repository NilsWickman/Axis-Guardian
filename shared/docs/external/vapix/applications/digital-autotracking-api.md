## Digital autotracking event declaration​

AXIS Digital Autotracking is an AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) application that detects and tracks moving objects within a defined area. When an object is tracked, the application emits an event. A client application that listens to events from AXIS Digital Autotracking can use the event to, for example, record video during tracking or send a notification when tracking starts.

When AXIS Digital Autotracking detects a moving object, the application uses one of the product’s view areas to zoom in on and track the object. While tracking, the application continues to monitor the camera’s entire field of view. If a second moving object is detected, the view area is adapted to include all moving objects. Tracking continues until all objects have stopped or disappeared from the area. This behavior differs from mechanical autotracking, which is available in some PTZ cameras. Mechanical autotracking locks on a single object and follows that object within the camera’s range of coverage.

To use AXIS Digital Autotracking, the application must be uploaded to the Axis product and it must be started. The application can be configured by setting up a view area to be used for autotracking, by modifying the include area and, optionally, by modifying exclude areas and ignore filters. Include and exclude areas define the parts of the scene in which moving objects should be tracked. Ignore filters are used to avoid tracking objects such as shadows of swaying trees, lights from passing cars and small animals regardless of where in the scene the objects appear.

When there are moving objects in the camera’s field of view, the application tests the object’s position, size and movements against the include area, exclude areas and filter conditions to determine if the object should be tracked or ignored. If an object is tracked, an event is emitted.

Include area, short-lived object filter and small object filter require AXIS Digital Autotracking 2 or later.

If using ignore filters, tracking will not start and events will not be emitted until the filter conditions have been tested and the tests have passed. For example, when using the Time parameter (short-lived object filter), tracking starts if the object is still moving when the set time has passed. That is, tracking and emitted events will be delayed by the set time. If the event is used to start a recording, it is recommended to configure the pre-trigger time in the recording setup so that the recording also includes the time the object moved in the scene before being tracked.

When the application is configured using the Axis product webpages, visual confirmation can be used to help understand the effect of the different filters. When visual confirmation is enabled, colored polygons show which objects the application tracks and which objects the application ignores.

Visual confirmation requires AXIS Digital Autotracking 2 or later.

The view area to use for digital autotracking must have PTZ enabled and should have the same aspect ratio as the camera’s capture mode (parameter ImageSource.I0.Sensor.AspectRatio). Which resolution to use depends on the camera model and the area under surveillance but the resolution cannot be larger than half the resolution of the full view. The maximum zoom level is automatically adapted to the view area resolution.

AXIS Digital Autotracking can be used while a guard tour is running. The guard tour will be stopped temporarily when digital autotracking starts and will resume when autotracking stops. Manual pan/tilt/zoom operations, for example using a joystick or mouse, have precedence over autotracking. If required, this behavior can be changed by configuring the PTZ Control Queue settings, see Network Video > Pan/Tilt/Zoom API in VAPIX®.

AXIS Digital Autotracking is intended for fixed cameras with at least megapixel resolution and can be installed in Axis network cameras that support view areas and AXIS Camera Application Platform. AXIS Digital Autotracking does not require any license.

The following table shows the differences between different versions of Digital autotracking.

When upgrading from version 1.1 to version 2, the following settings will be kept: view area for autotracking, exclude areas, swaying object suppression filter. Other settings will be set to their default values.

Request:

Response:

Modify the application configuration. The application is configured by uploading a new application configuration file. It is possible to define which view area to use, to modify the size of the include area, to add and configure exclude areas and to modify filter values. All other settings should be kept as is. If changing the name of a named object, the corresponding parameter value must be changed to match the new name.

Include area, short-lived object filter and small object filter require AXIS Digital Autotracking 2.

For more information, see Digital autotracking 2: Application configuration or Digital autotracking 1: Application configuration.

In this example, two new named objects and corresponding parameters are added. The named object View Area and parameter VA instruct the application to use view area 7. The named object Exclude Area 1 and parameter EA1 define an exclude area. Changes are marked in bold.

xinternal_1 is an internal camera event.

The application configuration is an XML file with named objects and a rule. The named objects define the view area to use, the include area, exclude areas and ignore filters. In the rule, the named objects are used as parameter values. If using exclude areas, the rule must be updated with one parameter for each exclude area.

This section applies to AXIS Digital Autotracking version 2. Version 1 is described in Digital autotracking 1: Application configuration.

The following types of named objects can be configured:

Example configuration:

The table below lists the XML elements and attributes used to define named objects and rules. The elements not listed in the table define how the application shall run in AXIS Camera Application Platform and must not be changed.

The application configuration is an XML file with named objects and a rule. The named objects define the view area to use, exclude areas and the swaying object suppression ignore filter. In the rule, the named objects are used as parameter values. If using exclude areas, the rule must be updated with one parameter for each exclude area.

This section applies to AXIS Digital Autotracking version 1. Version 2 is described in Digital autotracking 2: Application configuration.

The following types of named objects can be configured:

Example configuration:

XML User Configuration Data Description

The table below lists the XML elements and attributes used to define named objects and rules. The elements not listed in the table define how the application shall run in AXIS Camera Application Platform and must not be changed.

The application uses one of the product’s view areas for autotracking. For the application to work, the application configuration must be updated with the view area to use. The view area must be enabled, use the same aspect ratio as the camera’s capture mode and must have PTZ enabled.

In the application configuration, the view area is a named object.

In the rule, the view area named object is used by the VA parameter.

The include area is the area in which moving objects will be tracked. Objects moving outside the include area will be ignored.

Include area is supported by AXIS Digital Autotracking 2 and later.

In the application configuration, the include area is a named object.

The include area is set up as a polygon with 3–20 points describing the polygon corners. The line defining the polygon sides is drawn from point to point in the order the points are listed. Each point is a coordinate pair with one x and one y coordinate. The top right corner of the camera view is at x=1.0 and y=1.0. The bottom left corner is at x=-1.0 and y=-1.0.

If the video stream is rotated, the coordinates of the unrotated video stream should be used when configuring the application.

In the rule, the include area named object is used by the IncludeArea parameter.

An exclude area is an area in which moving objects are ignored. Exclude areas are optional. Up to 10 exclude areas can be used.

In the application configuration, each exclude area is a named object.

The exclude are is set up as a polygon with 3–20 points (AXIS Digital Autotracking 2) or 3–10 points (AXIS Digital Autotracking 1). The points describe the polygon corners. The line defining the polygon sides is drawn from point to point in the order the points are listed. Each point is a coordinate pair with one x and one y coordinate. The top right corner of the camera view is at x=1.0 and y=1.0. The bottom left corner is at x=-1.0 and y=-1.0.

If the video stream is rotated, the coordinates of the unrotated video stream should be used when configuring the application.

When using exclude areas, the rule must be updated with one parameter for each exclude area. The parameter is called EA# where # is an index starting from 1 (AXIS Digital Autotracking 2) or from 0 (AXIS Digital Autotracking 1).

The swaying object filter is used to avoid tracking objects that only move a short distance, for example moving trees, flags and their shadows. If the swaying objects in the scene are large, for example large ponds or large trees, it is recommended to use exclude areas instead of the filter. The filter will be applied to all moving objects in scene and, if set to a value too large, important objects might not be tracked.

When the swaying object filter is enabled and the application finds a moving object, tracking will not start until the object has travelled a distance larger than the set filter size. The event emitted by the application will be emitted when tracking starts. If the event is used to start a recording, configure the pre-trigger time so that the recording also includes the time the object moved in the scene before being tracked.

In the application configuration, the swaying object filter is the named object used by the SwayingObjectSuppression parameter. The filter size is an integer between 10 and 100. The value 100 implies that an object must travel from its initial from to one third of the image width or height before being tracked. The value 50 implies half that distance, that is, the object must travel a distance one sixth of the image width or height before being tracked. To disable the filter, use 0 or a negative integer.

Short lived object filter is supported by Digital Autotracking 2 and later.

The short-lived object filter is used to avoid tracking objects that only appear for a short period of time, such as light beams from a passing car and quickly moving shadows. When the short-lived object filter is enabled and the application finds a moving object, tracking will not start until the set time as passed. The event emitted by the application will be emitted when tracking starts. If the event is used to start a recording, configure the pre-trigger time so that the recording also includes the time the object moved in the scene before being tracked.

In the application configuration, the short-lived object filter is the named object used by the Time parameter. The filter size is an integer that specifies the number of seconds to wait before emitting the event. To disable the filter, use 0 or a negative integer.

Small object filter is supported by Digital autotracking 2 and later.

The small object filter is used to avoid tracking objects that are too small. For example, if only moving cars should be tracked, the small object filter can be used to avoid tracking people and animals. When using the small object filter, take into consideration that an object far from the camera appears smaller than an object close to the camera.

The filter is defined by specifying the maximum width and maximum height of the objects to ignore. To be ignored, the object must be smaller than the set width and by the set height.

In the application configuration, the small object filter is the named objects used by the Height and Width parameters. Each filter’s size can be set to an integer between 5 and 100 and is the maximum object width or height measured in percent of the image width or height. To disable the filters, use 0 or a negative integer.

The small object filter is defined using the unrotated video stream. Width and height will be interchanged if the image is rotated 90 or 270 degrees, for example for cameras that support autorotation and that are mounted at a 90 or 270 degree angle. If the image is rotated 90 or 270 degrees, the object height should be entered as Width and vice versa when the application is configured through the API. The application webpage takes image rotation into account and displays height as width if the image is rotated.

To upload and control the application, use the functions in Application API. To retrieve the application configuration and to modify settings, use vaconfig.cgi from Application configuration API.

The digital autotracking event is true when autotracking is active, that is, then the application follows a moving object.

camera specifies the view area used for autotracking and is numbered starting from 1. Example: camera=1 corresponds to view area 0 (defined by parameter Image.I0).

active defines whether the application tracks a moving object or not. Digital autotracking will remain active until an event with active = 0 is sent.

The line defining the polygon sides is drawn from point to point in the order the points are listed. Each point is a coordinate pair with one x coordinate and one y coordinate.The top right corner of the camera view is at x=1.0 and y=1.0 |
| point | x | -1.0 ... 1.0 | Attribute x is the x coordinate. |
|  | y | -1.0 ... 1.0 | Attribute y is the y coordinate. |
| int | value | Integer | An integer defining the filter value or which view area to use.For information about the view area, see View area for autotracking.For information about the swaying object filter, see Swaying object filter. |
| rules |  |  | Contains parameters for the application rule. |
| parameter |  |  | Application parameter. Each named object must have a corresponding parameter.Attribute name must have one of values listed below.Attribute value specifies which named object to use for the parameter. |
|  | name | SwayingObjectSuppression | Parameter specifying which named object to use for the swaying object filter.See Swaying object filter. |
|  |  | EA0 EA1 ... EA9 | Optional. Parameters specifying which the named objects to use for the exclude areas. Use one parameter for each exclude area.See Exclude areas. |
|  |  | VA | The view area to use.See View area for autotracking. |
|  |  | Duration | Internal parameter. |
