The IdPoint service is used for management of IdPoints. An IdPoint is a representation of a physical device where a user can input identification information. For example:

The diagram shows the data types that are used by the IdPoint Service.



A functioning IdPoint consists of two parts:

These two structures are connected by giving them the same token. These structures can be added or removed in any order. When only one of them exists, the IdPoint service will not do anything with the data until the complementary structure is set.

Creating an abstract IdPoint is straight-forward. The token returned can be used to set the IdPointConfiguration later. Note that the opposite order is also possible. Alternatively, it is possible to use predefined tokens.

Request

Request

Hardware configuration of the IdPoint is done in the IdPointConfiguration structure. It consists of token, DeviceUUID, Configuration and IdDataConfiguration. These configuration fields are described in turn below

An IdPoint is bound to a specific hardware unit using the DeviceUUID field. When setting an IdPointConfiguration with an empty DeviceUUIDfield, the field will be filled in with the UUID of the device to which the request is made. This will bind the configuration to that specific unit. For more information about the UUID field, see UUID.

The Configuration data structure describes the common hardware devices connected to the door controller and their connection types, see table. Some of the settings generate new IoUsers that can be bound to physical pins using axisio:SetIoAssignment, see I/O assignment service guide.

When issuing a call to SetIdPointConfiguration without a value for all parameters, one of two things will happen:

Available parameters in the Configuration data structure.

Implementing mV

It is recommended that you place a supervised resistor-circuit as close to the monitoring device as possible.



For example, the circuit schema for serial first is used for supervised settings specifically for AXIS A1601 Network Door Controller, with the mV values listed in the first table below.

On the other hand, the circuit schema for parallel first is used for the supervised settings of the mV values, and refers to the column Parallel 22k 4k7 in the second table below.



This table showcases the mV values for an open collector output with 1k pull-up to 5V (HID RK40) when using IdPointConfiguration.Tampering

This table showcases the mV values for a basic switch when using either IdPointConfiguration.REX or DoorConfiguration.Doormonitor.

This is a configuration for a Wiegand reader (e.g. HID RK40 with default parameters). It has the following features:

Note that IdDataConfiguration is set to empty in this request since it will be covered later. Note also that DeviceUUID is set to empty here. This will be replaced by the UUID of the device to which the request is made.

Once this configuration has been set together with its corresponding IdPoint, some IoUsers will exist on the unit to which the request was made. See I/O assignment service guide for how to assign these to physical pins.

For an OSDP reader, it is only necessary to assign the serial pins since LED, beeper, tampering information etc. is sent using serial commands. Here we are assuming a half-duplex RS485 connection.

The RS-485HD IoUser can now be assigned using the I/O Assignment service, see I/O assignment service.

Step1: Start by adding a key to the key store, by issuing the following to the axkey service:

Step 2: Continue by configuring an IdPoint. Please refer to the IdPoint service for details:

Once the IdPoint is set, add an IdPointConfiguration, using the same token as in the call to tid:SetIdPoint. Note that there are further parameters for SetIdPointConfiguration - only those relevant to OSDP secure channel configuration are shown here. Please refer to IdPoint Service API for details.

The IdPoint is now configured to use the key with the token my_key from the keystore (the value of this key is 00010203040506070809101112131415). We have also specified that we will use this key as a base key (no diversification using cUID). Valid values for KeyType are KeyBase, KeyMaster or None. Once the steps above have been completed, the rest of the setup may be done as usual, to get a working system (IO assignments, doors, access points, credentials and users).

For a multi-drop setup, each IdPointConfiguration shall be set to manual detection mode and specify the OSDP address of the corresponding reader.

Example for reader with address 0:

All IdPointConfigurations shall be assigned to the same serial port to which the readers are connected. See the I/O assignment service guide on how to assign multiple IoUsers to the same I/O.

Note that AXIS A1610 and AXIS A1210 support up to two OSDP readers per port. AXIS A1601 supports one OSDP reader per port.

A REX device can be represented as a standalone IdPoint or be added to an IdPoint that already has a reader. It is possible to connect an unlimited amount of REX devices to the same IdPoint using the I/O Assignment service, see I/O assignment service guide.

Here is an example of an IdPoint that contains only a REX device. The REX device is active when the circuit is closed.

When this has been set, a REX IoUser has been created for this IdPoint that can be assigned to one or more physical pins.

The IdDataConfiguration data structure specifies access card formats. The structure contains a mapping of the access card’s binary data into key/value pairs as well as the binary data’s complete bit length. The mapping describes how to interpret the binary data bits.

Some access card formats are provided by default, for example the Wiegand 26-bit format (H10301). Use axtid:GetIdDataConfigurationList to retrieve the list of available configurations.

The IdPoint/Request/IdData event is sent when a person swipes his access card. The event contains raw data from the card in the Card field and the bit length of the raw data in the BitCount field. If the IdPoint has no assigned IdDataConfiguration, or if no assigned IdDataConfiguration matches the bit length, the event contains only the Card and BitCount fields.

The general format for the IdDataFieldMap is <Format>, <Format>, ...<br/><br/>

where <Format> is described in the table below.

Available data field formats

All the chunks will then be added together to form the value of the map. The most common case will be to use a single M-N format for each IdDataFieldMap. The constant data is only useful for adapting to legacy systems.

The table below shows the available encodings.

Available data encodings

This section is an example for the H10301 format.

The table shows the data field mapping. Note that the CardNrHex is supplied as an example to show that it is possible to use the same bits but with different encodings (compare with CardNr).

H10301 data field mapping

Let us assume that the 26 bits received from the reader are:

1 0000 0000 0010 0111 1110 0101 1

This will generate key/value pairs as described in the table below. Note that the complete raw data is always automatically encoded as hexadecimal and supplied in the Card field.

Key/Value pairs example

The complete axtid:SetIdDataConfiguration request would look like:

Request

Request

To get information about the last swiped card or other type of user token accepted by the reader, use the axtid:GetLastCredential API call. This will also be parsed using the IdDataConfiguration.

The Card and BitCount fields are always included, also if they are not in the IdDataConfiguration.

Axis physical access control products support IP based remote activity input devices such as IP card readers , License Plate Recognition cameras and Wireless sensors via the Indicate Remote Activities API. This provide a way for most IP devices to simulate activities such as presenting credentials or REX (Request to exit) inputs such as Wiegand, OSDP (Open Supervised Device Protocol) or via wireless sensors.

One typical use-case is license plate recognition, where an Axis camera sends the license plate number to the Access Controller, which in turn decides if the vehicle should be granted access. Further examples can be a remote indication of card swipes, PIN inputs or REX button-presses.

Calling the IndicateRemoteActivities API triggers the same type of endpoint events as a user swiping a card against a card reader or pushing a REX button that is directly connected to and configured by the Access Controller.

For each activity, two IdPoint events are sent. The first event is tns1:IdPoint/tnsaxis:Activity for all supported activities. Params are mandatory for Activity-type Card and PIN, but not allowed for REX. For Activity-type PIN a param named ‘PIN’ is mandatory.

For each activity, two IdPoint events are sent, which are the same amount as for the wired Wiegand/OSDP reader.

The first event is tns1:IdPoint/tnsaxis:Activity for all supported activities.

The Reason field for this event is:

The second event for each activity is:

Examples

For more examples on how to use remote activities, see Indicating remote activities.

A hardware configuration needs to be in place due to the IndicateRemoteActivities-request body requiring a valid IdPoint-token to be able to send the IdPoint events.

For detailed information about configuring the hardware, see AXIS A1001 and AXIS Entry Manager User Manual.

The second step is the access decision that will be triggered by the tns1:IdPoint/tnsaxis:Request event.

To get a positive access decision the following criteria need to be met:

The Name/Value pairs of the params in the API request need to match the Name/Value pairs of the IdData in a credential and have the same ordering. This credential needs to be associated with an AccessProfile, AccessPoint and IdPoint, that matches the ID and AuthenticationProfile as seen in Setting the credential.

Each Name in the Params of the IndicateRemoteActivities request must match the IdDataName in the IdFactor list of an AuthenticationProfile that is associated with either the Credential, AccessPoint or AccessProfile mentioned above. For additional information, see Setting the access point, Setting the access profile and Retrieve default configuration in the Access Control Service Guide.

If a Card and a PIN is expected from physical access control system all the following parameters are granted access:

But this can be denied access:

axtid = http://www.axis.com/vapix/ws/IdPoint

The IdPoint service handles identification points (IdPoints or IDP:s), which are typically card readers with keypads for pin code entry, but which could also be biometric readers. A Request-for-Exit button can also be seen as an IdPoint. Multiple physical readers/Identification Points can be handled by a service.

Use GetIdPointInfoList to get the list of IdPoints with brief information and capabilities. Use GetIdPointList to get the list of IdPoints and their configurations.

The IdPoint service sends events when there is activity, when a card is presented or pin is entered, etc. An Access Controller typically subscribes to these events and takes appropriate actions, e.g. unlocks a door. The FeedbackMessage function is used by the Access Controller to give feedback or annunciations to the user.

The way the identification data is to be interpreted and sent is assumed to be configurable in a vendor-specific way. By default, the IdData Name "Card" should be used to send card data as a lower case hex string. Keypad input is sent as IdData Name "PIN" as string, PIN:s can be alfanumeric. REX request is sent as IdData Name "REX" with the value "Active".

The IdPoint generates events with IdData encoded as SimpleItem in the Data: section of the Notification. Additional IdData entries can be configured in a vendor-specific way.

Please refer to the ONVIF Access Control specification for generic operation guidelines and design principles behind ONVIF PACS services family.

| IdPoint.Hardware.Address | Hexadecimal number | Applies to both Aperio readers and Smart Intego readers. The reader’s hardware address. A six-digit hexadecimal number for Aperio readers, for example A0B1C2 and a hexadecimal number for Smart Intego readers, for example 0x200. When used to specify the OSDP/HADP reader address, i.e. when the IdPoint.Hardware.DetectionMode parameter is set to Manual, the hexadecimal number should be between 0 and 7E. Numbers outside of this interval will be interpreted as 0. Note that AXIS A1610 and AXIS A1210 support up to two OSDP readers per port. AXIS A1601 supports one OSDP reader per port. |
| IdPoint.Hardware.DetectionMode | Auto Manual | Applies only to OSDP and HADP readers. If set to Auto, the driver will automatically scan all addresses to find the connected reader. If set to Manual, the address of the connected reader is specified using the IdPoint.Hardware.Address parameter. The default value is Auto. The Auto mode can be used reliably only when there is only a single reader connected to the port. OSDP multi-drop setups must use the Manual mode. |
