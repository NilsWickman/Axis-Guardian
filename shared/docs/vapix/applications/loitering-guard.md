### ONVIF MotionAlarm event​

AXIS Loitering Guard is an AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) product for Axis network cameras. Loitering Guard supports fixed cameras, PTZ cameras and encoders. The ACAP makes it possible for the user to define a guarded zone by setting up one or more areas in which loitering should be detected.

The ACAP makes it possible for the user to:

The Loitering Guard API is used for configuring the behavior of the ACAP. It is possible to configure where and if a detected object should trigger an alarm.

There is support for ONVIF motion alarm event.

The API consists of five methods:

Software: EmbeddedDevelopment version 2.13 or higher is required for the ACAP to work.

Property: Properties.EmbeddedDevelopment.Version=2.13

In order to check if the ACAP is installed, use /axis-cgi/applications/list.cgi, which shows the status of all installed ACAPs. It also lists the url to the configuration page and the license state of the ACAP.

Use this example to backup the configurations in the camera, but also restore them without having to set each parameter individually.

Request the current configuration of the application:

JSON input parameters

Visualize alarming objects in live view and recorded video

Use this example to see all alarming objects in order to know what causes alarms in both the live view video as wall as in the recorded video.

Configure with overlayResolution and alarmOverlayEnabled.

Request

Response

Validate the streams.

All video streams use the chosen resolution (e.g. 1280x720) and the specified rotation will have alarming objects with burnt in bounding boxes.

It is possible to request a video stream that ignores the alarm overlay despite using the chosen resolution. If the stream parameter overlays is set to either none or dynamic the overlay from the application is not shown.

Use this example to retrieve the boundaries and default values of all the parameters that are needed to create a flexible and useful user interface.

Request the configuration capabilities of the application:

JSON input parameters

Parse the JSON response.

a. Success response example.

b. Failure response example.

The configured JSON object is modified according to getConfigurationCapabilities.

Changes between apiVersion 1.2 to 1.3

Adds support for alarm overlays, which includes two new optional fields in the configuration of the application.

All APIs uses the same CGI-call, using the method property to decide the operation to perform on the data.

The different APIs uses the same error code patterns.

Error codes from 1000 to 1999 are reserved for camera application (server) errors, e.g. could not read configuration from file. The actual cause can be seen in the server-log, and the problem could in some cases be solved by restarting the camera.

Error codes from 2000 to 2999 are reserved for client errors, e.g. wrong format on the configuration file or an invalid parameter. These errors should be possible to solve by changing the input data to the API.

Error code 8000 indicates that the camera is not supported by this version of the application. This should be possible to solve by downloading the version of the application designed for the camera type.

Error codes from 9000 to 9999 are reserved for license related errors, e.g the current license is invalid or missing. These errors should be possible to solve by uploading a new license file for the ACAP.

Request the current configuration of the ACAP.

Request

Return value - Success

Returns the current configuration of the ACAP in a JSON formatted response. In the following examples the values d, w, h, t, x, y, p and r are numbers. For a complete description of each field in the configuration see Configuration parameter description.

Channel specific properties are set in data.cameras. However, each profile has its individual settings, and also refers to a camera id property with the data.profiles[j].camera property. The parameter "presets" is not present however, as it is only supported for mechanical PTZ-cameras.

Return value - Error

Return value XXXX is a number.

Sets the configuration of the application. The application is not restarted, meaning that any ongoing event will be set as inactive when the new configuration is applied. This will cause ongoing recordings to stop, and for multichannel products, all cameras will be simultaneously affected.

There is a size limitation on POST transfer request which makes it suitable to send a minified JSON structure without white-spaces and new lines.

Modify specific properties

Below are some examples for how to change the values in the JSON file to perform specific actions. In the examples i is an index in the profile-array, not the uid of the profile.

Enable alarm overlay

In order to enable alarm overlay for a profile the resolution has to be specified for the camera in params.cameras[i].overlayResolution. Supported resolutions are listed by the getConfigurationCapabilities method. These resolution will change if the capture mode in the camera is changed.

Each profile connected to a camera can be specified to visualize its alarming objects in the video by activating params.profiles[i].alarmOverlayEnabled.

Set image rotation

The image rotation for which the configuration is done should be specified in params.cameras[i].rotation. Valid values are (0, 90, 180, 270), which corresponds to the rotation of the camera.

Modify loitering area

To change the loitering area, i.e. the determined zone of detection, of a profile consisting of n connected straight lines the client must first connect the points [x0, y0], [...], [xn, yn]. Then, to trigger individual objects, the client must change the property params.profiles[i].triggers to:

Note that the individual and group conditions cannot be active at the same time.

Modify exclude areas

To add an exclude area for a profile consisting of n connected straight lines, which in turn are connecting the points [x0, y0], ..., [xn,yn]. The property params.profiles[i].filters should then be changed to:

Note that the exclude area object is removed if the exclude area is not in use.

Modify size perspective filter

In order to apply a size perspective filter with width w and height h and two perspective bars with height h1 and h2 that are located at [x11, y11], [x12, y12] and [x21, y21], [x22, y22] respectively, both the params.profiles[i].perspective and the size filter has to be modified.

The perspective bars are added by changing params.profiles[i].perspective to

The size filter in params.profiles[i].filters should then be modified to:

The filter values width w and height h as well as the heights of the perspective bars should be given in cm. Note that only one size filter can active at any given time, meaning that sizePercentage must be disabled if sizePerspective is used. It is also crucial that the camera rotation is the same as the rotation specified in the configuration. The filter will automatically be disabled when the camera rotation differs from the rotation in the configuration, however it will become active once again when they become equal. Hence, the order for uploading the configuration and setting the rotation parameter of the camera is not crucial.

Set percentage filter

To apply a percentage filter with height h and width w in percent of the image, params.profiles[i].filters should be modified to:

Note that only one size filter can be active, meaning that sizePerspective must be disabled if sizePercentage is used. The width and height of an object follows the camera rotation, and the direction used will change if the rotation parameter is changed. That is for a camera with a 640x360 resolution and a filter with width 10% and height 20% that corresponds to a box of 64x72 pixels if the camera rotation is 0 or 180 degrees. However, if the rotation is changed to 90 or 270 degrees, the same filter setting (width 10% and height 20%), corresponds to a box of 36x128 pixels.

Set swaying object filter

In order to set the swaying object filter value to d percent of the image params.profiles[i].filters should be modified to:

The filter value d determines how far an object has to move from its point of origin before it can trigger an alarm. It is given in percent of the image. Note that this is a global setting and will also delay alarms from all objects in the image with that distance, which could introduce missed alarms if the value is set too high.

Modify presets (only for PTZ cameras, PTZ encoders are not supported)

To change the presets of a profile change the property params.profiles[i].presets to:

where p is the id-number of the preset, the index value in the VAPIX-parameter PTZ.Preset.P0.Position.P<index>. The value can also be -1 for any-preset or -2 for anywhere.

Request

For a complete description of each field, see Configuration parameter description.

Return value - Success

Note that successful calls contains en empty data object.

Return value - Error

Return value XXXX is a number.

Request the boundaries and default values of the application.

Request

Return value - Success

Returns the boundaries and default values of the application in the form of a JSON formatted response. This CGI will always return the same result for one camera independent of when it is called, i.e. these values cannot be changed through a CGI. However, different cameras might return different result depending on their capabilities. In the following examples, the values p, q, r and z are numbers. For a complete description of each field in the configuration, see Configuration capabilities parameter description.

Return value - Error

Return value XXXX is a number.

Get a list of supported API versions for the application (one for each major version).

Request

Return value - Success

Return value - Error

Return value XXXX is a number.

Introduction

By using this method, it is possible to send a stateful alarm event, both in the Axis and ONVIF format, for the specific profile <uid>. The stateful alarm event is active for a few seconds. The response message will be returned immediately. This can be used by clients to check that the configuration is correct (e.g. that it starts recording). All events related to the profile will be sent, both in the Axis and ONVIF format.

The profile will send events independent of its current state, i.e. in PTZ products, profiles that are connected to other than the current preset will also send events if triggered by the sendAlarmEvent method.

Request

Return value - Success

Return value - Error

Return value XXXX is a number.

The structure of a configuration object is the same in both the data object in the response for getConfiguration and the params object in the request for setConfiguration. The structure is the same for single and multichannel products, where the cameras objects should mirror the different VAPIX camera properties. The only difference appears when PTZ cameras are used, in which case the parameter preset can be optionally included.

Example configuration

The following example configuration will be described in details in the table section below.

Parameter description table

All parameters and properties are considered mandatory unless otherwise specified. The default values for the filters and triggers are recommended values. To get the values used by the application, see getConfigurationCapabilities.

The cameras objects contains general information that is the same for all of the profiles using that particular camera.

The profiles object information for each individual profile.

The exclusion filters of profiles[j].filters have similar structures. The exclusion filters are all optional, and a filter is considered disabled if it is not present in the array profiles[].filters.

The data field for each exclusion filter.

It is only possible to have the exclusion filter "sizePerspective" if there is a perspective. It is described by an array of perspective objects, that calibrates the view of the camera. The only type of perspective objects are bar.

The only type of trigger in Loitering Guard is loiteringArea. The array profiles[j].triggers should contain exactly one loitering area.

Conditions

Parameter presets Description

In apiVersion 1.1 the parameter profiles[j].presets is introduced as an array, which can contain at most one preset. The profile will not be connected to any presets if the presets array is empty, and will always be active, i.e. it is connected to "anywhere". The client is responsible for connecting a profile to an existing preset. Note that if the connected preset is deleted, there is no automatic handling for updating the configuration, and the parameter will cause an error in non PTZ-cameras.

The parameter is optional in PTZ-cameras, and if the parameter is omitted it is equivalent to an empty array, i.e. the profile is always active.

A parameter value for any-preset is -1 and for anywhere it is -2.

If all presets have a profile connected to them, one can use the event CameraXProfileANY to also capture triggers from all presets, where the settings can be adapted for each preset.

Different apiVersion values foralarmOverlay parameters

apiVersion 1.3 introduced the parameters profiles[j].alarmOverlayEnabled and cameras[i].overlayResolution. They control if the alarms from a profile should be burnt into the video.

Worth noting is that the application should support clients using apiVersion 1.2 or older.

The values are enabled from a configuration using at least apiVersion 1.3. Later, if a client with apiVersion 1.2 or lower configures the application, the values for profiles[j].alarmOverlayEnabled and cameras[i].overlayResolution are ignored if present and the values from the existing configuration is used instead.

The tables below describe the parameters in getConfigurationCapabilities.

Declaration of the LoiteringGuard event

The declaration of the Loitering Guard event can be accessed through the VAPIX and ONVIF event web service API:s.

The declaration of the Loitering Guard event as received from the VAPIX API:

The event in this example is named CameraXProfileY and is sent every time a condition has triggered an alarm. It is based on a profile with camera=X and uid=Y. If it is a multi-channel product the NiceName attribute is changed to:

The name of the camera is taken from the parhand using the Image.I<index>.Name parameter. Value <index> is the same as the camera source value camera=X minus one.

The properties can be used to match the criteria and trigger an action rule:

Declaration of the LoiteringGuard events for multichannel product

The following example shows how an event declaration will look for a scenario with a multichannel product with two cameras, and each camera has two profiles. The Namespaces and unnecessary tags has been removed for readability.

CameraXProfileANY event

When the ACAP detects an object entering a loitering area, it will be sent as an ANY event element for a specific camera.

The declaration of an ANY event as received from the VAPIX API:

The event in this example is named CameraXProfileANY and is sent every time an object has entered a specific Loitering area. It is based on a profile with camera=X. If it is a multi channel product the NiceName attribute is changed to:

The name of the camera is taken from the parhand using the Image.I<index>.Name parameter. Value <index> is the same as the camera source value camera=X minus one.

CameraANY event

When the application detects an object entering an Loitering area, it will be sent as a global ANY event element. A global ANY event is an ANY event for ANY camera, which means an alarm on any of the channels will also trigger this event.

The declaration of such a global ANY event event as received from the VAPIX API:

The event stream

A client may subscribe to events from the VAPIX/ONVIF event stream. The format of the stream and its elements are described in http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver10/schema/onvif.xsd and http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver10/topics/topicns.xml.

Using Vapix, this stream can be retrieved over RTSP using the url:

It is also possible to listen for a specific profile as shown below:

CameraXProfileY

When the ACAP detects an object entering a loitering area, it will be sent as an event element. An example of such an event is described below.

The UtcTime of the message refers to the time of the event, i.e. this should be in sync with time stamps in an image stream with images of the actual physical event that took place.

Synchronize metadata with video stream

Axis cameras uses the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) for controlling the media streaming between the camera and its clients. RTSP uses the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) for the packet format for the streaming of the meta/video data, and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) for the synchronization of the metadata and video data stream. The synchronized conversion from the absolute time (UTC timestamp) at the loitering detection to the relative time (RTP timestamp) for the video stream, can be found in the RTCP packets.

Declaration of the MotionAlarm event

The declaration of the ONVIF Motion Alarm event can be accessed through the VAPIX and ONVIF event web service API:s. ONVIF event corresponds to CameraXProfileANY event. An ONVIF event will be sent if there is an ANY event being sent for a specific camera.

The declaration of the ONVIF Motion Alarm event as received from the VAPIX API:

The event stream

A user may subscribe to events from the VAPIX/ONVIF event stream. The format of the stream and its elements are described in http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver10/schema/onvif.xsd and http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver10/topics/topicns.xml.

Using VAPIX, this stream can be retrieved over RTSP using:

- anywhere (value: -2): A profile that is connected to anywhere is always active, both if the PTZ-camera points at the preset or if it is manually moved away from it. Settings for such a general profile should be used with care to handle all different conditions, e.g. a large Loitering area and a small short-lived filter.
- any-preset (value: -1): A profile that is connected to any-preset is active as long as the camera is at ANY preset, but not if it is manually moved away from the preset. This setting should also be used with care, however it is useful for connecting a general action rule, where false alarms are OK, e.g. turn on lights.

- Property=<active>: Required. When movement is detected in the area the event is activated. When the movement disappears the event is inactivated.
- <active>: A stateful event. An active event has the value "1", and the inactive event has the value "0".

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "sizePercentage" | [int, int] | [5, 5] | [3..100, 3..100] | An array with width and height ([w, h]) in percent of the image. If the height and width of an object is measured as a percentage of the total camera view is lesser than, or equal, to the set values, it will not be able to raise an alarm. |
| "sizePerspective" | [int, int] |  |  | An array with width and height ([w, h]) in real-world size for an object in the scene. If the object’s width and height is below this value, it will not raise an alarm. The real-world height of the object is computed by comparing the pixel height of the object with the pixel height of the perspective bars. Since the perspective bars each have a real-world height assigned to them by the user, the corresponding height of the object can be computed using a linear equation. Two objects with the same height in pixel but at different horizontal positions will have different real-world heights. |
| "distanceSwayingObject" | int | 5 | 3..10 | Max distance object is allowed to sway without raising an alarm. The swaying distance is given in percent of the image. |
| "excludeArea" | [[float, float], ... [float, float]] |  | -1, .. 1 | An exclude area is described as an array of points [[x0, y0], ..., [xn, yn]], where the unit are normalized to the size of the image, so that the visible view spans from -1 to 1 in both horizontal and vertical directions. Each profile can contain up to three exclude areas. |
