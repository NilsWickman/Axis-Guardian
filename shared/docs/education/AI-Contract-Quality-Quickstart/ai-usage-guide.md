# AI-Assisted Development Guide for AXIS Surveillance System

## Overview
This document outlines best practices for using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) effectively and responsibly in the AXIS project while maintaining individual learning and professional development goals.

## Philosophy: AI as a Force Multiplier

### Heavy Usage Encouraged
AI tools should be used **extensively** throughout development to:
- **Accelerate Learning**: Get explanations for complex concepts instantly
- **Boost Productivity**: Generate boilerplate code and documentation
- **Improve Quality**: Get code reviews and suggestions for improvements
- **Solve Problems**: Debug issues and explore solution approaches
- **Enhance Creativity**: Brainstorm architectural solutions and design patterns

### Individual Responsibility Framework
With great AI power comes great responsibility:

1. **Understand What You Use**: Never copy-paste without comprehension
2. **Verify Everything**: AI can be wrong; always validate suggestions
3. **Learn from AI**: Use AI to deepen understanding, not replace thinking
4. **Document AI Usage**: Be transparent about AI assistance in your work
5. **Maintain Skill Growth**: Ensure you're becoming a better developer, not just faster

## Strategic AI Usage by Development Phase

### 1. Requirements Analysis & Planning

#### Recommended AI Tasks
```
Prompt: "I'm working on a surveillance system that needs to correlate
detections across multiple cameras. What are the key technical challenges
and architectural considerations I should be aware of?"
```

**Use AI For**:
- Understanding domain-specific concepts (computer vision, RTSP, ONVIF)
- Identifying potential technical challenges
- Exploring architectural patterns
- Generating user story templates
- Creating test scenarios

**Individual Responsibility**:
- Verify AI suggestions against project requirements
- Research cited technologies independently
- Validate assumptions with team and stakeholders

### 2. Architecture & Design

#### Recommended AI Tasks
```
Prompt: "Help me design a microservices architecture for a surveillance
system with these requirements: [paste requirements]. Consider scalability,
real-time processing, and team autonomy."
```

**Use AI For**:
- Exploring architectural patterns (event-driven, microservices, etc.)
- Understanding trade-offs between different approaches
- Generating system diagrams and documentation
- Reviewing architecture decisions
- Learning about relevant technologies

**Individual Responsibility**:
- Understand why specific patterns are recommended
- Adapt AI suggestions to project constraints
- Validate scalability claims with performance considerations
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs)

### 3. Implementation

#### Code Generation Best Practices

**Effective Prompts**:
```python
# Good prompt structure
"""
Context: I'm building a FastAPI service for camera management in a surveillance system.

Task: Create a FastAPI endpoint that:
- Accepts camera configuration via POST
- Validates using Pydantic models
- Stores in PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy
- Returns standardized error responses

Constraints:
- Use async/await
- Follow our error handling patterns: [paste example]
- Include proper type hints
- Add logging for debugging

Current code structure: [paste relevant existing code]
"""
```

**Use AI For**:
- Generating boilerplate code (FastAPI routes, database models, etc.)
- Creating unit test templates
- Writing documentation and docstrings
- Implementing common patterns (error handling, validation, etc.)
- Debugging complex issues

**Individual Responsibility**:
- Understand every line of generated code
- Modify AI code to fit project standards
- Add appropriate error handling and logging
- Write comprehensive tests
- Refactor for maintainability

#### Debugging with AI

**Effective Debugging Prompts**:
```
Problem: Getting intermittent WebSocket disconnections in my Vue frontend

Error: [paste exact error message]

Context:
- Using Vue 3 with TypeScript
- WebSocket connects to Python FastAPI backend
- Happens only under high detection load
- Network tab shows: [paste relevant info]

Code: [paste minimal reproducible example]

Help me understand what might be causing this and suggest debugging approaches.
```

### 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

**Use AI For**:
- Generating comprehensive test cases
- Creating mock data and fixtures
- Writing integration test scenarios
- Reviewing code for potential bugs
- Optimizing performance bottlenecks

**Example Test Generation**:
```
Prompt: "Generate pytest test cases for this camera detection function:
[paste function]

Cover these scenarios:
- Valid detection data
- Invalid detection formats
- Network timeouts
- Camera offline scenarios
- Edge cases with confidence scores

Use our testing patterns: [paste example test]"
```

## Prompt Engineering for Maximum Effectiveness

### Context Management Strategies

#### 1. Project Context Template
Create a reusable context block:

```markdown
# AXIS Surveillance System Context

## Project Overview
- Multi-team surveillance system (Frontend, Communications, Intelligence)
- Microservices architecture with contract-first development
- Python/FastAPI backends, Vue/TypeScript frontend
- Real-time detection correlation across multiple cameras

## Current Architecture
[Paste relevant architecture details]

## Code Standards
- Python: Black, Ruff, MyPy, type hints required
- TypeScript: ESLint, Prettier, strict types
- Testing: pytest (Python), Vitest (TypeScript)
- API: OpenAPI contract-first development

## My Current Task
[Describe specific task]

## Question/Request
[Your specific question]
```

#### 2. Conversation Memory Management
- **Save Important Conversations**: Export key discussions for reference
- **Reference Previous Context**: "As we discussed earlier about the detection correlation algorithm..."
- **Update Context**: Regularly update AI with project progress and changes

#### 3. Incremental Refinement
```
Initial: "Help me write a detection processor"
Better: "Write a Python class that processes camera detections"
Best: "Write a Python class that processes Detection objects from our OpenAPI contract, correlates them spatially using our coordinate system, and publishes events via Redis. Use our logging and error patterns."
```

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

#### 1. Role-Based Prompting
```
"Act as a senior software architect reviewing my surveillance system design.
Focus on scalability, maintainability, and real-time performance requirements.
Identify potential issues and suggest improvements."
```

#### 2. Constraint-Based Prompting
```
"Generate a solution that MUST:
- Use only standard library imports
- Handle errors gracefully without crashing
- Complete processing in <100ms
- Be testable with unit tests
- Follow our existing patterns: [paste example]"
```

#### 3. Comparative Analysis
```
"Compare these three approaches for camera detection correlation:
1. In-memory spatial indexing
2. PostgreSQL with PostGIS
3. Redis with geospatial commands

Consider: performance, complexity, scalability, maintenance burden"
```

- **Poor problem decomposition**: Asking AI to solve entire features

#### Healthy AI Usage Patterns
- **Explain then implement**: Ask AI to explain approach, then implement yourself
- **Iterative refinement**: Start with AI suggestion, improve through understanding
- **Verification-first**: Always test and validate AI suggestions
- **Learning focus**: Use AI to understand "why" not just "how"

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### Code Security with AI

#### Safe Practices
- **No Secrets in Prompts**: Never paste API keys, passwords, or sensitive data
