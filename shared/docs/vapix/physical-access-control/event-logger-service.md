The event logger service is used for event logging and management of events and alarms. The service provides ignore filters and alarm filters as well as functions for fetching events and alarms and for acknowledging alarms. Ignore filters determine if an event should be ignored or if it should be stored in the event log.

Alarm filters determine if an event should be marked as an alarm. Door controllers with device software 1.20 and later support global event distribution, that is, events emitted by one door controller in a door controller network are replicated on all door controllers in the network. When global distribution is enabled, logged events and alarms can be fetched from any door controller in the network, not only from the controller that emitted the event. Global distribution is enabled by default but can be disabled if required, see Event distribution. In addition to the Event Logger Service, the ONVIF Profile C conformant AXIS A1001 Network Door Controller supports the ONVIF event framework including real-time pull-point subscription, WS notification and event streaming.

Ignore filters determine if an event should be ignored or if it should be stored in the event log. The filter contains a list of key-value pairs of events to ignore and a list of UUID:s specifying the door controllers to which the filter should be applied. Events with key-value pairs and a UUID matching the filter will be ignored. If the filter is applicable to all door controllers, the UUID field can be left empty.

The following example shows how to set up an ignore filter with the key-value pair "a=1" and UUID "abc". An event that has a key "a" with value "1" will be ignored if the event was emitted from the door controller with UUID "abc".

If the UUID list is empty (or omitted) the filter applies to all door controllers.

It is possible to omit the value in a key-value pair. The following example shows an ignore filter that ignores all events containing the key "b".

Request

To list the current ignore filters, the axloc:GetIgnoreFilterList call is used. The response below shows the first axloc:SetIgnoreFilter example set up above.

To remove an ignore filter, use axloc:RemoveIgnoreFilter and specify the token of the filter to remove. The token is obtained using axloc:GetIgnoreFilterList.

Alarm filters determine if an event should be marked as an alarm. Alarms are typically used to mark events that are more important than other events, for example events that require human attention. Alarms are stored in a separate alarm log but are also kept in the event log together with other events. When an alarm is acknowledged, it is removed from the alarm log but is kept in the event log.

The alarm filter syntax is similar to the ignore filter syntax described in the previous section. If no UUID:s are specified, the filter will be applied to all door controllers. If one or more UUID:s are specified, only events from the specified door controllers will be elevated to alarms.

To indicate that an event is marked as an alarm, a special event is sent. This special event cannot be elevated to an alarm as that would cause a cyclic behavior.

If an event matches both an ignore filter and an alarm filter, the event will be marked as an alarm and will also be stored in the event log, that is, the ignore filter is overridden.

To list the current alarm filters, the axloc:GetAlarmFilterList call is used.

Use axlog:FetchEvents or axlog:FetchEvents2 to fetch events from the event log. The event log can contain maximum 30,000 events but only 1000 of these events can be fetch in one call. The calls accepts the following optional parameters: Start, Stop, Limit, RowID, Descending and Filters. axlog:FetchEvents2 also supports FilterSets. The parameters are described in the following sections.

The Start and Stop parameters define start and stop times for the time interval in the axlog:FetchEvents call. Events with a timestamp within the time interval will be fetched. If Start is omitted, year 0 is assumed. If Stop is omitted, the time interval has no upper limit, that is, all events until the current time will be fetched. The start and stop times should be specified using the time format in ISO 8601.

Request

Request

One call to axlog:FetchEvents returns maximum 1000 events. If required, for example to improve performance, the maximum number of fetched events can be reduced using the Limit parameter.

Request

Request

If the number of events matching a fetch request is larger than the set limit, the reply will have the More flag set to true. To fetch the rest of the events matching the request, call axlog:FetchEvents again but this time with the RowID parameter set to the row id of the last event in the previous response.

Request

Request

The Descending parameter is used to sort events in descending order. By default, Descending is false and events are sorted in ascending order. To get events in descending order, set Descending to true.

Request

Request

The Filters parameter is used to fetch events of a specific type. The axlog:FetchEvents request will return events that match the key-value pairs specified in Filters.

Request

Request

Filters can contain a single key-value pair or a list of key-value pairs. It is also possible to omit the value and only specify the key.

Request

Request

The FilterSets parameter provides advanced filtering options and is supported by axlog:FetchEvents2. FilterSets contains multiple Filters fields that are combined with logical OR.

The request below fetches events that match the condition (SystemReady AND 0) OR (DoorPhysicalState AND Closed).

Request

The following is an example of a axlog:FetchEvents response, where the request is using filters to only return results from AccessControl:

Request

Request

Response

Response

Below is an event shown which has been received using an ONVIF pull-point subscription. The data stored in the event logger can be matched against the real-time event in every detail except namespaces. The namespaces in the topic are not stored in the event logger database and cannot be recreated in the FetchEvents call.

Use axlog:FetchAlarms or axlog:FetchAlarms2 to fetch alarms. These commands are used in same way and take the same parameters as the axlog:FetchEvents and axlog:FetchEvents2 commands..

The alarm list contains at most 200 alarms, which makes it possible to fetch all of them with one call. However, the limit option is still supported, and is defaulted to 1000 which means all alarms are fetched by default.

Request

The response with matched alarms will be formatted as the example in section FetchEvents response.

An alarm is acknowledged by removing it from the alarm list. To remove the alarm axlog:RemoveLoggedAlarm is used. axlog:RemoveLoggedAlarm takes a token array with all the tokens of the alarms to be removed.

Request

Request

Door controllers with device software 1.20 and later support global event distribution, that is, events emitted by one door controller in a door controller network are replicated on all door controllers in the network. When global distribution is enabled, logged events and alarms can be fetched from any door controller in the network, not only from the controller that emitted the event.

To identify the door controller that emitted the event, an UUID key-value pair is automatically added to all events when global distribution is enabled.

Global distribution is enabled by default, but can be disabled if required. When global distribution is disabled, logged events and alarms are not replicated on other door controllers.

To check whether global distribution is enabled, use axloc:GetEventDistributionConfig without any arguments.

Response

Response

To disable global distribution, use axloc:DisableGlobalDistribution.

To enable global distribution, use axloc:EnableGlobalDistribution.

In ONVIF pull-point subscriptions, use content filter "device source" to listen to events from all door controllers in the network. If global event distribution is enabled and device source is not specified, the client receives event notifications from the local door controller only. This is the default behavior. To subscribe to events from all door controllers in the network, add content filter@Name="Device Source". To subscribe to events from selected door controllers, add content filter @Name="Device Source" with specified UUIDs.

If global event distribution is disabled, the pull-point subscription must not include content filter device source. If @Name="Device Source" is included, the client will not receive any event notifications as the events do not have any device source.

To subscribe to events from all door controllers when global distribution is enabled and from the local door controller when global distribution is disabled, use boolean(//tt:SimpleItem[@Name="Device Source"])OR NOT( boolean(//tt:SimpleItem[@Name="Device Source"]))

The following table lists supported notification topics. Note: The notification topics available in the door controller depend on product configuration and device software version.

The eventlogger configuration holds filters for incoming events. These filters are matched against incoming events and decides if an event is either ignored, stays as a normal event or is upgraded to an alarm.

An event that is ignored will not be stored in any database. An event that is upgraded to an alarm is stored in both the event and alarm database.

If an event matches both an ignore filter and an alarm filter then the event will be upgraded to an alarm.
