## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Timeline:** One semester (~14-16 weeks)
- **Team Experience:** Low experience with real-time systems and computer vision

### Assumptions
- Axis API documentation and support will be available
- Team members can dedicate 8 hours per week
- University provides necessary computing infrastructure
- RTSP streams can be simulated for testing
- Users must authenticate to access system functions

- Detection and identification handled by cameras (not system-level)
- System will support object type classification (person/vehicle/animal)

### Uncertainties (To Be Resolved)
- Exact camera integration protocol details
- Geo-positioning accuracy requirements
- Performance/latency requirements
- Scale requirements (number of cameras/zones)
- Specific LLM integration use cases
- 2D vs 3D map representation
