AXIS Video Motion Detection 4 is an AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) application that detects moving objects in the camera’s field of view. When a moving object is detected, AXIS Video Motion Detection 4 sends an alarm (event). A client application that listens to events from AXIS Video Motion Detection 4 can use the event to, for example, record video or send a notification.

AXIS Video Motion Detection 4 is preinstalled in products with AXIS OS 6.50 and later but must be started before it can be used. In products with older AXIS OS, the application must first be uploaded and then started. The application can be configured by modifying the include area and, optionally, exclude areas and ignore filters. Include and exclude areas define the parts of the scene in which moving objects should be detected. Ignore filters are used to avoid detecting objects such as shadows of swaying trees, lights from passing cars and small animals regardless of where in the scene the objects appear.

When there are moving objects in the camera’s field of view, the application tests the object’s position, size and movements against the include area, exclude areas and filter conditions to determine if the object should be reported as detected or ignored. If the object is reported as detected, an event is emitted.

When using ignore filters, events will not be emitted until the filter conditions have been fulfilled. For example, when using the Short-lived Object Filter parameter, events will be sent if the object is still moving when the set time has passed. That is, all events will be delayed by the set time. If the event is used to start a recording, it is recommended to configure the pre-trigger time in the recording setup so that the recording also includes the time the object moved in the scene before being detected.

When the application is configured using the Axis product web pages, visual confirmation can be used to help understand the effect of the different filters. When visual confirmation is enabled, colored polygons show which objects the application detects and which objects the application ignores.

AXIS Video Motion Detection 4 (VMD4) with dynamic background filter and support for three include areas now replaces the built-in motion detection. It will eventually also replace AXIS Video Motion Detection 3 (VMD3).

The API consists of five methods:

AXIS Video Motion Detection 4 is preinstalled in Axis network video products with AXIS OS 6.50 and later. Use applications/list.cgi to list applications, it also lists the url to the configuration page.

AXIS Video Motion Detection 4 can be uploaded to Axis network video products with:

Multiple profiles are supported by the same amount of entries [i] as there are channels. For more information, see Parameter description table.

It is not possible to get the configuration from a stopped application.

All code listings are examples. See API documentation for a detailed description of each API command.

Use this example to back up all of the configurations in a camera, and later restore them without having to set each parameter individually.

The different API’s all uses the same CGI-call, using the method property to decide the operation to perform on the data.

All of the included API’s uses the same error code pattern. Error codes from 1000 to 1999 are reserved for camera application (server) errors, for example: could not read configuration from file. The actual cause can be seen in the server-log, and the problem could in some cases be solved by removing and reinstalling the application. Error codes from 2000 to 2999 are reserved for client errors, for example: wrong format on the configuration file or an invalid parameter. These errors should be possible to solve by changing the input data to the API.

Changes between version 1.0 to 1.1

Preset, an optional parameter for mechanical PTZ cameras was supported from apiVersion 1.1 and forward. For mechanical PTZ cameras, each profile can be connected to one preset. If a preset is added, the profile will only be active when the camera is at the given preset. If this parameter is omitted or the profile is not connected to any preset it will always be active.

In apiVersion 1.1 it is only possible to connect a profile to at most one preset, however, the parameter is set as an array.

The preset parameter is only valid for mechanical PTZ camera.

Changes between version 1.1 to 1.2

Adds a method to get the capabilities as well as the default and boundary values for the application.

Request the current configuration of the application.

Request

Response Success

Returns the current configuration of the ACAP, in a JSON formatted response. In the following examples the values d, w, h, t, x, y and rare numbers. For a complete description of each field in the configuration see Parameter description table.

The response if the camera supports multiple channels, eg. AXIS F44.

Channel specific properties are set in data.cameras. However, each profile has its individual settings, and refers to a camera id property with the data.profiles[j].camera property.

Error

See General error response.

Set the configuration of the application. The application is not restarted and any ongoing events will be set as inactive when the new configuration is applied. This will cause ongoing recordings to stop, and for multichannel products all cameras are affected simultaneously. However, if there is still motion in the include area after the new configuration is set, and no exclusion filter hinders the alarm to be sent, the event will be set to active directly after new configuration is applied.

There is a size limitation on POST transfer request which makes it suitable to send a minified JSON structure without white-spaces and new lines.

Modify specific properties

Below are some examples for how to change values in the json file to perform specific actions. In the examples <i> is an index in the profile-array, not the uid of the profile.

Set image rotation: The image rotation for which the configuration is done should be specified in params.cameras[i].rotation. Valid values are (0, 90, 180, 270), which corresponds to the rotation of the camera.

Modify include area: To change the include area of a profile consisting of n connected straight lines connecting points [x0,y0], …, [xn,yn] change the property params.profiles[i].triggers to:

Modify exclude areas: To add an exclude area for a profile consisting of n connected straight lines, connecting points [x0,y0], …, [xn,yn] change the property params.profiles[i].filters to

Note that the exclude area object is removed if the exclude area should not be used.

Set percentage filter: To apply a percentage filter with height h and width w in percent ofimage,params.profiles[i].filters should be modified to

Set short-lived object filter: In order to set the short-lived object filter value to t seconds params.profiles[i].filters should be modified to

Set swaying object filter: In order to set the swaying object filter value to d percent of the image params.profiles[i].filters should be modified to

The filter value d determines how far an object has to move from its point of origin before it can trigger an alarm. It is given in percent of the image. Note that this is a global setting and will also delay alarms from all objects in the image with that distance, which could introduce missed alarms if the value is set too high.

Modify presets:

Only PTZ cameras are supported (PTZ encoders are not supported).

To connect a profile to a PTZ preset, set params.profiles[i] to:

where p is the id-number of the preset (the index value in the VAPIX-parameter PTZ.Preset.P0.Position.P<index>). The value can also be -1 for any-preset, or -2 for anywhere.

A profile that is connected to anywhere (-2) is always active, both if the PTZ-camera points at a preset or if it is manually moved away from the preset. Settings for such a general profile should be used with care to handle all different conditions, for example a large include area and a small short-lived filter.

A profile that is connected to any-preset (-1) is active as long as the camera is at any preset, but not if it is manually moved away from the preset. This setting should also be used with care. It is useful for connecting a general action rule, where false alarms are acceptable, for example when a light is turned on.

Request the boundaries and default values of the ACAP.

Request

Response Success

Returns the boundaries and default values of the ACAP, in a JSON formatted response. This CGI will always return the same result for one camera independent of when it is called, i.e. these values cannot be changed through a CGI. However, different cameras might return different result depending on their capabilities. In the following examples the values p, q, r and z are numbers. For a complete description of each field in the configuration see Configuration capabilities parameter description.

By using this method, it is possible to send a stateful alarm event, both in Axis and ONVIF format, for a specific profile <uid>. The stateful alarm event is active for a few seconds. The response message will be returned immediately. This can be used by VMS installers to check that the VMS configuration is correct (for example: start recording). All events related to the profile will be sent, both in Axis and ONVIF format. A profile connected to a preset will also send an event even if the camera is not on the preset.

Request

Error

See General error response.

The structure of a configuration object is the same in both the data object in the response for getConfiguration and the params object in the request for setConfiguration. The structure is the same for single and multichannel products, where the cameras objects should mirror the different VAPIX camera properties.

Example configuration

The following example configuration will be described in details in the Parameter description table.

All parameters and properties are considered mandatory unless otherwise specified.

The cameras object contains general information that is the same for all profiles using that camera.

The profiles object contains information for each individual profile.

The exclusion filters of profiles[j].filters have similar structure. The exclusion filters are all optional, and a filter is considered disabled if it is not present in the array profiles[].filters.

The data field for each exclusion filter.

The only type of trigger in VMD is includeArea. The array profiles[j].triggers should contain exactly one include area.

In apiVersion 1.1 the parameter profiles[j]. presets was introduced. It comes in the form of an array which can contain at most one preset. The profile will not be connected to any presets if the presets array is empty however, and will always be active, i.e. it is connected to "anywhere". The user is responsible for connecting a profile to an existing preset. If the connected preset is deleted, there is no automatic handling for updating the configuration. The parameter will cause an error in non PTZ-cameras.

The parameter is optional in PTZ-cameras, and if the parameter is omitted, it is equivalent to an empty array, i.e. the profile is always active.

A parameter value for any-preset is -1 and for anywhere it is -2.

anywhere (value: -2):

A profile that is connected to anywhere is always active, both if the PTZ-camera points at a preset of if it is manually moved away from a preset. Settings for such a general profile should be used with care to handle all different conditions, e.g. a large include area and a small short-lived filter.

any-preset (value: -1):

A profile that is connected to any-preset is active as long as the camera is at ANY preset, but not if it is manually moved away from the preset. This setting should also be used with care. It is useful for connecting a general action rule, where false alarms are OK, e.g. turn on the lights.

General error response from VMD 4 API.

Return value XXXX is a number.

Supported elements, attributes and values:

Declaration of the VMD event

The declaration of the VMD event can be accessed through VAPIX and ONVIF event web service APIs.

The declaration of the VMD event as received from the VAPIX API:

The event in this example is named CameraXProfileY, it is sent every time an object has entered a specific include area. It is based on a profile with camera=X and uid=Y. If it is a multichannel product the nicename attribute is changed to:

The name of the camera is taken from the parhand using the Image.I<index>.Name parameter. Value <index>.is same as camera source value camera=X minus one.

The properties can be used for matching the criteria for triggering an action rule:

Property=<active>: Required. When movement is detected in the area the event is activated. When the movement disappears the event is inactivated.

<active>: A stateful event. An active event has the value "1", and an inactive event has the value "0".

Declaration of the VMD event for multichannel products

The following example shows how a event declaration will look for a scenario with a multichannel product with two cameras, and each camera has two profiles. The Namespaces and unnecessary tags has been removed for readability

CameraXProfileANY event

When the ACAP detects an object entering an include area, it will be sent as an ANY event element for a specific camera.

The declaration of an ANY event as received from the VAPIX API:

The event in this example is named CameraXProfileANY, it is sent every time an object has entered a specific include area. It is based on a profile with camera=X. If it is a multichannel product the nicename attribute is changed to:

The name of the camera is taken from the parhand using the Image.I<index>.Name parameter. Value <index> is same as camera source value camera=X minus one.

CameraANY event

When the ACAP detects an object entering an include area, it will be sent as a global ANY event element. A global ANY event is an ANY event for ANY camera, which means an alarm on any of the channels will also trigger this event.

The declaration of such a global ANY event event as received from the VAPIX API:

Legacy VMD 3 event

Legacy Video Motion Detection 3 (VMD 3) event corresponds to CameraXProfileANY event. A VMD 3 event will be sent if there is an ANY event being sent for a specific camera. This is used for VMS without dynamic event integration, where VMD 3 events are hardcoded. An example of such a VMD 3 event is described below.

The event stream

A client may subscribe to events from the event stream.

Using VAPIX, this stream can be retrieved over RTSP using the url:

It is also possible to listen for a specific profile:

CameraXProfileY

When the ACAP detects an object entering an include area, it will be sent as an event element. An example of such an event is described below.

The UycTime of the message refers to the time of the event, i.e. this should be In sync with time stamps in an image stream with images of the actual physical event that took place.

Synchronize metadata with video stream

Axis cameras uses the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) for controlling the media streaming between the camera and its clients. RTSP uses the Real­time Transport Protocol (RTP) for the packet format for the streaming of the meta/video data, and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) for the synchronization of the metadata and video data stream. The synchronized conversion from the absolute time (UTC timestamp) at the motion detection to the relative time (RTP timestamp) for the video stream, can be found in the RTCP packets.

Declaration of the MotionAlarm event

The declaration of the ONVIF Motion Alarm event can be accessed through the VAPIX and ONVIF event web service API:s. ONVIF event corresponds to CameraXProfileANY event. An ONVIF event will be sent if there is an ANY event being sent for a specific camera.

The declaration of the ONVIF Motion Alarm event as received from the VAPIX API:

The event stream

A client may subscribe to events from the VAPIX/ONVIF event stream. The format of the stream and its elements are described in http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver10/schema/onvif.xsd and http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver10/topics/topicns.xml

Using VAPIX, this stream can be retrieved over RTSP using the url:
