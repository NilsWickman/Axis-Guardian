## Footnotes​

The Serial port API is used to configure serial ports on Axis products. The API description in this section is intended to be used to get knowledge about how to change settings for the serial port. For example when to change serial port settings for an uploaded PTZ driver or get to know what type of settings that could be changed when adding some type of device with a serial port to an Axis product.

The serial port allows connection of equipment such as analog PTZ cameras to Axis products. The equipment is connected to a serial port on the Axis product, which in turn works as a translator between a network client and the equipment.

Ports can be a physical serial ports or remote port clients. Remote port clients connect to other CPU:s that have remote port servers open (the other product has a physical serial port that is made available by the server). The remote port connection is used for daisy chain cameras on multi CPU video encoders. A daisy chain connection means virtually connecting several cameras (without physical serial ports) to a CPU with a physical serial port.

For both types of ports, there is a port manager that manages the port. The port manager makes it possible to share the port, for example for PTZ control from multiple video channels.

Settings for port managers are stored in the parameter group PortManager.P#. Serial ports are described in the group Serial.Ser#, and remote port clients in RemotePort.R#.



The image above describes the different types of data that can be sent using a physical serial port.



The image above describes an overview of a connection between a remote serial port, a remote port server and a serial port. The remote port forwards data from a virtual port on a CPU to a physical port on another CPU. This is used in multi CPU encoders to share the serial port between the CPU:s. This functionality is only intended for multi CPU video encoders. Remote port is similar to Generic TCP/IP, but in addition to Generic TCP/IP it also adds a protocol header to the data payload.

Product category

Axis products with serial ports.

Send data to a device connected to the serial port. The argument write specifies how much data that should be sent.

Read 3 bytes from the selected serial port with a time out of 2000 milliseconds.

Set the baud rate (transmission speed) to 9600 for the serial port and the number of databits included in the set to 8.

Enable a generic TCP server on port 3000.

Clients that connect to port 3000 will get a TCP socket where raw data can be sent and received. That data will be forwarded to and from the serial port.

Request the remote port client to be managed by port manager 0.

Set a remote port server to listen on port 2500 of the host 10.0.0.1, and connect the remote port client to it.

PTZ commands sent out through the remote port client will reach the remote PTZ server.

Open port 2 (PortManager.P0), if not already opened, and connect video source 2 to it.

Disconnect video source 2 from any port.

PortManager.P#

The parameter group PortManager.P# describes a port manager. The indices # in PortManager.P# go from 0 to (number of port managers - 1).

PortManager.P#

Serial

The parameter Serial controls the functionality/purpose of the serial ports and some configuration that is shared by various applications.

Serial

Serial.Ser#

The sub-group Serial.Ser# contains settings for a serial port. The index # in Serial.Ser# starts from 1.

Serial.Ser#

The # in Serial.Ser# is replaced with a number starting from 1.

PortManager.P#.SerialCGI

The Enabled parameter in this sub-group is used to enable or disable the internal server that serial.cgi uses for connecting to the port manager.

PortManager.P#.SerialCGI

Remote ports can be used to daisy chain and forward data from a remote port on one CPU to a physical port on another CPU. This is used in video encoder blades to share the serial port between the CPU:s. This functionality is only intended for multi CPU video encoders. Daisy chain is similar to Generic TCP/IP, but in addition to Generic TCP/IP it also adds a protocol header to the data payload.

RemotePort.R#

The parameter group RemotePort.R# contains settings for a remote port client. The index # in RemotePort.R# starts from 0. Remote port server settings can be found in the parameter group PortManager.P#.RemotePortServer.

If the Axis product does not support the functionality this parameter group does not exist.

RemotePort.R#

PortManager.P#.RemotePortServer

The sub-group RemotePortServer contains parameters for remote port server, used for tunneling PTZ commands, generic TCP, and serial.cgi traffic.

If the Axis product does not support the functionality this parameter group does not exist.

PortManager.P#.RemotePortServer

PortManager.P#.RemotePortServer.Listener

The sub-group RemotePortServer.Listener contains settings for listening for connections from remote port clients.

If the Axis product does not support the functionality this parameter group does not exist.

PortManager.P#.RemotePortServer.Listener

PortManager.P#.PTZServer

The Enabled parameter in this sub-group is used to enable or disable the internal server that PTZ drivers use for connecting to the port manager.

PortManager.P#.PTZServer

The parameter group RemotePort.R# contains settings for a remote port client. The index # in RemotePort.R# starts from 0. Remote port server settings can be found in the parameter group PortManager.P#.RemotePortServer.

If the Axis product does not support the functionality this parameter group does not exist.

RemotePort.R#

The sub-group RemotePortServer contains parameters for remote port server, used for tunneling PTZ commands, generic TCP, and serial.cgi traffic.

If the Axis product does not support the functionality this parameter group does not exist.

PortManager.P#.RemotePortServer

The sub-group RemotePortServer.Listener contains settings for listening for connections from remote port clients.

If the Axis product does not support the functionality this parameter group does not exist.

PortManager.P#.RemotePortServer.Listener

The Enabled parameter in this sub-group is used to enable or disable the internal server that PTZ drivers use for connecting to the port manager.

PortManager.P#.PTZServer

PortManager.P#.GenericTCPServer

The sub-group GenericTCPServer contains settings for the generic TCP server. Generic TCP means that the server listens on a TCP port, and when a client connects a socket is opened. Data received over the socket is sent out on the serial/remote port, and data received on the port is sent out over the socket.

PortManager.P#.GenericTCPServer

PortManager.P#.GenericTCPServer.ConnectTo

The sub-group GenericTCPServer.ConnectTo contains settings used when the port manager acts as a client and connects to another host. A host could for example be another encoder or server. When data is received the host connects to the client via generic TCP. The connection is similar to a remote port connection (see Remote ports) but only raw data is sent directly, without a protocol.

PortManager.P#.GenericTCPServer.ConnectTo

PortManager.P#.GenericTCPServer.Listener

This sub-group contains settings for the server functionality of the generic TCP server.

PortManager.P#.GenericTCPServer.Listener

The CGI serial.cgi enables the Axis product to write and read raw data on the serial port through a HTTP request.
