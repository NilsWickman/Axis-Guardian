Deprecated. Trigger data functionality, that is, trigger data in H.264, MPEG-4 and MJPEG headers, is deprecated and will eventually be removed. Trigger data is replaced by event data streaming, see section Event data streaming.

The JPEG header, the MPEG-4 GOV header and the H.264 SEI message contain Axis specific comment fields. One of the fields in the image header can be enabled to contain trigger data. The trigger data field describes different conditions in the Axis product. Triggers can be enabled according to requirement, for example:

User defined triggers can also be used which means that the triggers of interest are specified. For example specific motion detection windows, triggers connected to another video source in a video encoder etc.

When enabled to include triggers, all these states will be included in the JPEG header, GOV header or H.264 SEI message. This allows the receiving application to lose trigger data blocks without necessarily losing a changed state since the current state is included.

In this document, MPEG-4 is short for MPEG-4 Part 2.

The parameters (see Parameters) are managed through the Parameter Management CGI param.cgi.

This examples describes the trigger data block in a network camera. The trigger data block shows that audio, digital input 0 and 3 are not triggered. Digital input 1 and 2 are triggered as well as camera tampering on video source 0. Motion is detected for window 0 and the motion level for window 0 is 35. Video source 0 has video.

In this example, we will consider a network camera with two motion detection windows.

Enable user data and include trigger data:

Request:

Response:

Body:

Restart the network camera for these settings to take effect.

A listing of the default configuration would look like this:

This would result in a trigger data block similar to this:

Continuation of example 2: In this example the UserTriggers parameter is used to specify a trigger. The parameter MotionDetectionEnabled is set to no and the trigger M0 is set as values for the UserTriggers parameter. If the MotionDetectionEnabled parameter would have been set to yes, both motion detection windows for Image.I0 (M0 and M1) would have been used. All other triggers from example 2 are included in the trigger request in the example below.

Request:

Response:

Body:

This will result in a trigger data block in the header. No triggers have been activated in this example.

Deprecated. Trigger data functionality, that is, trigger data in H.264, MPEG-4 and MJPEG headers, is deprecated and will eventually be removed. Trigger data is replaced by event data streaming, see section Event data streaming.

The Axis product must be restarted for this parameter to take effect.

Image

The Axis product must be restarted for these parameters to take effect.

Image.I#.MPEG

The # in Image.I#.MPEG is replaced by an integer starting from zero, e.g. Image.I0.MPEG.

For each image configuration Image.I#, the TriggerData parameters specify the triggers included in the trigger data. The UserTriggers parameter can be used to include only a few triggers or triggers from other image configurations.

Image.I#.TriggerData

The # in Image.I#.TriggerData counts the image configurations and is replaced by an integer starting from zero, e.g. Image.I0.TriggerData. The number of image configurations is given by the Image.NbrOfConfigs parameter.

Three different types of data can be included in the comment header, GOV header and H.264 SEI message:

To include product information and time stamps in the user data for MPEG-4 or H.264, set the Image.I#.MPEG.UserDataEnabled parameters (one for each image configuration) to yes. To include trigger data for MPEG-4, H.264 and MJPEG, set the Image.TriggerDataEnabled parameter to yes.

The Axis ID field identifies the type of user data:

The product information user data field contains information such as hardware ID, AXIS OS version and serial number.

The time stamp user data field contains information about the user time and unit time. For products with AXIS OS 5.00 and later, the unit and user times are equivalent, but both are kept for backwards compatibility.

Deprecated. Trigger data functionality, that is, trigger data in H.264, MPEG-4 and MJPEG headers, is deprecated and will eventually be removed. Trigger data is replaced by event data streaming, see section Event data streaming.

The trigger data field is an optional field which can be included in the comment header, GOV header and H.264 SEI message. For further information about triggers see Trigger data blocks.

Deprecated. Trigger data functionality, that is, trigger data in H.264, MPEG-4 and MJPEG headers, is deprecated and will eventually be removed. Trigger data is replaced by event data streaming, see section Event data streaming.

The trigger data block contains the states of all triggers, as opposed to just including a changed state in one block when it occurs. This allows the receiving application to lose trigger data blocks without necessarily losing a changed state.

The trigger data block, same for all supported video formats, is a block of text containing trigger states in this format:

Where <trigger> is a tag for the trigger and <state> is a text describing the state. The following table lists defined trigger tags and their possible states.

For MJPEG the trigger data block is included as a comment header for each image. The image may contain several comments in this format:

An example of a comment header. The comment section starts with ff fe, the length is 00 48 and the trigger data starts with 0a 03 (marked in bold in the example)

For MPEG-4 the trigger data block is included as "user data" in the GOV header. The GOV header may contain several data blocks following each other in this format. The GOV header is inserted into the MPEG-4 stream at regular intervals. A new GOV header can also be forced to be inserted as soon as possible when a trigger changes state. This is done for I/O triggers to reduce the latency.

An example of user data in the GOV header. The user data section starts with 00 00 01 b2 and the trigger data starts with 0a 03 (both marked in bold in the example)

For H.264 the trigger data block is included as "user data" in the SEI NAL units marked as type user data unregistered. The H.264 SEI message is inserted into the H.264 stream at regular intervals. A new H.264 SEI message can also be forced to be inserted as soon as possible when a trigger changes state. This is done for I/O triggers to reduce the latency.

The first field in the H.264 SEI message is an UUID identifier filled with 16 consecutive 0xAA bytes. The next three fields are the payload data block including the length of the data block, an identifier and the actual user data. Each SEI may contain several payload data blocks.

For further information about H.264 SEI message please refer to the standard document ISO/IEC 14496-10 Supplemental enhancement information.

An example of user data in the SEI NAL units. The user data section starts with aa aa ... aa. There are three length values 00 0d, 00 0d, 00 46. The trigger data starts with 0a 03. Axis UUID identifier, the size of user data and trigger data start are marked in bold in the example.
