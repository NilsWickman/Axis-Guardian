Axis products with audio capabilities usually support two-way audio, that is the Axis product can both transmit and receive audio. Using a built-in or external microphone, the Axis product can capture audio and transmit the audio to the network. Using built-in or external speakers, the Axis product can play audio received from the network. Most products support full duplex and half duplex transmission modes but can also be configured to use simplex modes where the product can only receive or only transmit audio. As audio surveillance is restricted in many countries, audio streaming can always be disabled.

For information about audio clips, see Media clip API.

Audio from the Axis product can be streamed together with H.264/MJPEG video over RTP/RTSP (including RTP over RTSP over HTTP), together with MJPEG video over HTTP, or on its own. When streaming over RTP/RTSP, audio and video are synchronized. Supported audio compression standards are product-dependent but usually includes G.711, G.726, AAC and Opus. For sample rates and bit rates, see Audio compression formats. AAC should be streamed over RTP/RTSP as streaming over HTTP is not part of the standard. AAC and Opus support stereo audio in addition to mono.

Audio settings are defined by parameters in the Audio and AudioSource groups. Many audio settings are global but the Audio.A# groups can be used to set up different audio configurations to be used in different streams. When requesting an HTTP or RTSP stream, argument audio determines if audio is streamed or not. If audio is omitted, the parameter settings determine if audio is included in the stream.

To enable audio, parameters Audio.A#.Enabled and AudioSource.A#.AudioSupport must both be set to yes.

Axis network video products can support some or all of the following audio modes:

Axis network video products can support all or some of the following audio compression formats

The Audio API is supported if:

The Properties.Audio parameters lists supported audio capabilities.

Properties.Audio

Enable audio in the Axis product. AudioSource.A0.AudioSupport=yes enables audio from audio source 0. Audio.A0.Enabled=yes enables audio configuration 0.

Request an RTSP stream with video and audio.

Request an audio stream over HTTP.

Limit the maximum number of clients that can receive audio at the same time.

Configure the audio source parameters.

The Audio group contains audio parameters used for all audio configurations.

Audio

The Audio.A# groups contain settings for different audio configurations. The audio configurations can be used when requesting audio streams.

The # in Audio.A# is replaced by a group number starting from zero, e.g. Audio.A0.

Audio.A#

The AudioSource group contains settings for the product’s audio sources.

AudioSource

The AudioSource.A# groups contain settings for the different audio sources. The # is to be replaced by an integer starting from zero, for example AudioSource.A0

AudioSource.A#

AudioSource.A#.Channel.C

The default audio source is AudioSource.A0. The default audio device, input and output IDs are 0.

Request and configure an audio stream.

Syntax:

With the following argument and values:

Request an audio stream:

Request a singlepart audio stream using HTTP:

Successful request

If the request was successful, the server returns a continuous flow of audio packets. The content type is only set at the beginning of the connection. When the connection is up and running audio packets will come one after another without any extra information between the packets.

Return
Successful response to a HTTP request. Here, singlepart audio data with G.711 μ-law compression is returned.

Syntax:

Failed request

If the specified parameter value is invalid, the server returns 400 Bad Request.

Return

Syntax:

Request a multipart audio stream using HTTP:

Successful request

If the request was successful, the server returns a continuous flow of audio packets. The content type is "multipart/x-mixed-replace" and each audio packet ends with a boundary string. The message body contains a block of binary data. The content length provides the size of each block of coded audio which varies for different codecs: G.711 has 512 bytes block size, G.726 32 kbit/s has 256 bytes and G.726 24 kbits/s has 192 bytes. AAC is not supported.

Return
Successful response to a HTTP request. Here, multipart audio data with G.726 32 kbit/s compression is returned.

Syntax:

Failed request

If the specified parameter value is invalid, the server returns 400 Bad Request.

Return

Syntax:

Transmit a singlepart audio data stream:

Check what audio formats your Axis product can transmit. For a complete list of audio formats supported by VAPIX® see Audio compression formats.

Syntax:

Syntax:

There are no arguments and values to transmit.cgi.

When an audio stream is transmitted, the server receives a continuous flow of audio packets. The content type is only set at the beginning of the connection together with the content length that can have any value. When the connection is up and running the audio packets will come right after another without any extra information between the packets. The message body contains a block of binary data.

The content length must be set to a valid size and will generate a server response for every successful playback. If the playback fails, the connection will be closed without any response.

Transmit singlepart audio using G.711 µ-law (authorization omitted):

This section describes the error responses that can occur when using the API.

Media streams transmitted over RTSP include audio if the request contains audio=1 or if parameters Audio.A#.Enabled and AudioSource.A#.AudioSupport are enabled. If audio=0, the stream does not include audio even if the parameters are enabled.

When AudioSource.A#.AudioSupport is enabled, the camera and audiochannel arguments from audio/receive.cgi can be used when requesting RTSP streams. The camera argument specifies both the video source and the audio configuration.

The Audio Detection event is true when the sound level rises above the audio alarm level defined by parameter AudioSource.A#.AlarmLevel.
