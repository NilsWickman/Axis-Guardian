This section lists network parameters.

Network interface settings. The parameters in this group (as opposed to the subgroups of this group) are static network settings. If the Network.BootProto=dhcp these parameters may not be in use. Check the read-only parameters in the subgroups to retrieve actual network settings in use by the Axis product.

Network

Enable/disable whether it is possible to set the IP address of the Axis product with ARP/Ping.

Network.ARPPingIPAddress

Enable/disable Bonjour and set the name to be displayed in Bonjour-clients.

Network.Bonjour

Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System according to RFC 2136.

Please note that updating the DNS name will require a sequence of VAPIX commands described below. This will initiate a new DNS name update from your Axis device to the DNS server, however issuing only an update of the Network.DNSUpdate.DNSName is not enough to trigger a new DNS update request.

Step 1

Step 2

Network.DNSUpdate

Network settings of the first Ethernet interface. Use these parameters to retrieve the network settings actually in use by the Axis product.

Network.eth0

Network settings of IPv6 on the first Ethernet interface. Use these parameters to retrieve the network settings actually in use by the Axis product.

Network.eth0.IPv6

IP address filtering. These parameters are used to only accept connections from certain IP addresses or networks.

Network.Filter

IP addresses filtering for incoming data traffic.

Network.Filter.Input

Enable/disable logging of filtered packages.

Network.Filter.Log

Defines the HTTP, HTTPS and RTSP server authentication capabilities in Axis devices from AXIS OS version 5.70 and higher. By using the parameter Network.HTTP.AuthenticationPolicy you can set the authentication capabilities to either Basic, Digest, Basic_Digest, or Recommended. Default value is Recommended.

For RTSP communication, the authentication is performed by default on the RTSP server and controlled via Network.RTSP.AuthenticateRTSPOverHTTP if it has been set to yes. This option can be disabled and System.HTTPAuthRTSPOverHTTP can be used instead to authenticate RTSP requests over HTTP.

The parameters in this group enables the Axis product to access a network protected by IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol Over Lan).

Network.Interface.I0.dot1x

The parameters in this group sets the identity and password to access to a network protected by IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol Over Lan).

Network.Interface.I0.dot1x.EAPTLS

Network interface settings for IPv6. The parameters in this group are static network settings. If AcceptRA=yes and/or DHCPv6 is used it will probably result in additional configuration. Check the read-only parameters in the other subgroups to retrieve actual network settings in use by the operation system.

Network.IPv6

Quality of Service classification. These parameters holds the DSCP value common for the members of a QoS class.

Network.QoS.Class1

Quality of Service classification. These parameters holds the DSCP value common for the members of a QoS class.

Network.QoS.Class2

Quality of Service classification. These parameters holds the DSCP value common for the members of a QoS class.

Network.QoS.Class3

Quality of Service classification. These parameters holds the DSCP value common for the members of a QoS class.

Network.QoS.Class4

Enable/disable retrieval of Domain Name System (DNS) settings from DHCP server. The actual DNS settings in use by the Axis product are located in this group.

Network.Resolver

Routing table actually in use by the Axis product.

Network.Routing

Routing table for IPv6 actually in use by the Axis product.

Network.Routing.IPv6

Parameters related to multicast RTP.

Network.RTP

Parameters related to multicast RTP. One group for each possible multicast presentation (for example video source).

Network.RTP.R#

The # is replaced with a group number starting from zero, e.g. Network.RTP.R0.

Parameters needed by the RTSP daemon.

Network.RTSP

Enable/disable Universal Plug and Play and set the name to be displayed in UPnP-clients.

Network.UPnP

These parameters control NAT traversal functionality. To make the task of port forwarding easier, Axis offers the NAT traversal functionality in many of its network video products. NAT traversal is a technique that can be used to open up routers and firewalls to make devices on a LAN accessible from the Internet.

Network.UPnP.NATTraversal

Enable/disable retrieval of host name from DHCP-server. The host name, actually in use by the Axis product, is located in this group.

Network.VolatileHostName

Enable/disable automatic configuration of link local IP address. The negotiated network settings are located in this group, and are used in parallel with the setting of the Network.eth0 group. That means that both addresses can be used simultaneously.

Network.ZeroConf

The SNMP section of this API will be deprecated as of AXIS OS version 13.0 and will no longer receive updates. It is replaced by the Device Configuration SNMP Configuration API.

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) configuration.

SNMP

Traps are used by the camera to send messages to a management system for important events or status changes. These settings are used with SNMP v1/v2.

SNMP.Trap

This parameter group contains a parameter for trap messages.

SNMP.Trap.T#

This parameter group contains a parameter for trap message when authentication attempt fails.

SNMP.Trap.T#.AuthFail

This parameter group contains a parameter for trap message when the camera is rebooted/resarted.

SNMP.Trap.T#.Coldstart

This parameter group contains a parameter for a trap message when a link changes from down to up.

SNMP.Trap.T#.LinkUp

This parameter group contains a parameter for a trap message when SNMP has started and the configure file has changed, but not the MIB (Management Information Base).

SNMP.Trap.T#.WarmStart

This parameter group contains a parameter that can be used to enable and disable NTCIP. Please note that SNMP must be enabled before you can use this parameter.

SNMP.NTCIP
